# Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern

## Overview
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a fundamental architectural pattern that divides an application into three interconnected components:

1. **Model**: Manages data, logic, and rules of the application
2. **View**: Handles the visual elements and user interface
3. **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between Model and View

## Key Concepts

### Model
- Represents the application's data and business logic
- Independent of the user interface
- Notifies observers about state changes
- Manages data validation, persistence, and domain rules

### View
- Presents data to users
- Receives user input
- Sends user actions to the Controller
- Updates itself based on Model changes

### Controller
- Processes incoming requests
- Handles user input
- Updates the Model
- Selects the appropriate View

## Benefits
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier maintenance and testing
- Parallel development
- Code reusability

## Common Use Cases
- Web applications
- Mobile applications
- Desktop applications
- Enterprise software

## Best Practices
1. Keep the Model independent
2. Make Views as dumb as possible
3. Don't put business logic in Controllers
4. Use dependency injection
5. Implement proper event handling
