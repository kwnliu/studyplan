# VIP (View-Interactor-Presenter) Pattern

## Overview
VIP is a unidirectional architectural pattern derived from Clean Architecture principles. It organizes the flow of data and business logic in a cycle: View → Interactor → Presenter → View. Each component has a single responsibility and communicates only with its direct neighbors in the cycle.

## Key Components

### View (ViewController)
- Displays what it's told by the Presenter
- Handles user input
- Sends user actions to the Interactor
- Contains no business logic
- Maintains UI state

### Interactor
- Contains business logic
- Processes data
- Manages entity objects
- Calls workers/services
- Makes decisions
- Sends results to Presenter

### Presenter
- Formats data for display
- Prepares view models
- Contains presentation logic
- Tells the View what to display
- No business logic

### Models
1. **Request Models**
   - Data passed from View to Interactor
   - Contains user input

2. **Response Models**
   - Data passed from Interactor to Presenter
   - Contains processed business data

3. **View Models**
   - Data passed from Presenter to View
   - Ready for display

## Data Flow
1. View sends user action to Interactor (with Request Model)
2. Interactor processes business logic
3. Interactor sends result to Presenter (with Response Model)
4. Presenter formats data
5. Presenter sends display data to View (with View Model)
6. View displays data

## Benefits
- Clear separation of concerns
- Unidirectional data flow
- Highly testable
- Independent of frameworks
- Scalable and maintainable
- Easy to debug

## Best Practices
1. Keep components focused on single responsibility
2. Use protocols for communication
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Use dependency injection
6. Keep View as dumb as possible

## Common Use Cases
- iOS applications
- Complex view controllers
- Business-logic heavy features
- Enterprise applications
- Data-driven interfaces

## Implementation Tips
1. Use protocol-oriented programming
2. Create separate models for each data transfer
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Use dependency injection
5. Write unit tests for each component
