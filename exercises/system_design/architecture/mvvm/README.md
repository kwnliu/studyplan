# Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Pattern

## Overview
MVVM is an architectural pattern that facilitates the separation of the development of the graphical user interface from the development of the business logic (Model). The ViewModel acts as a data converter that makes Model information ready for the View.

## Key Components

### Model
- Represents the data and business logic
- Contains domain-specific classes and data validation
- Independent of the UI layer
- Notifies observers of state changes

### View
- Represents the UI elements
- Observes ViewModel for changes
- Forwards user actions to ViewModel
- Minimal to no business logic
- Can be replaced without changing other components

### ViewModel
- Acts as a mediator between Model and View
- Handles View logic and state management
- Prepares data for presentation
- Exposes data streams that the View can observe
- Contains no reference to the View

## Key Principles

1. **Data Binding**
   - Two-way binding between View and ViewModel
   - Automatic UI updates when data changes
   - Reduced boilerplate code

2. **Command Pattern**
   - User actions in View trigger commands in ViewModel
   - Encapsulates complex operations
   - Supports undo/redo functionality

3. **State Management**
   - ViewModel maintains UI state
   - Handles loading, error, and success states
   - Manages data transformation and validation

## Benefits
- Clear separation of concerns
- Highly testable architecture
- Improved maintainability
- Reusable ViewModels
- Better state management
- Enhanced code organization

## Common Use Cases
- iOS/macOS applications (with Combine/SwiftUI)
- Android applications (with Data Binding)
- Cross-platform mobile applications
- Desktop applications
- Modern web applications

## Best Practices
1. Keep Views dumb and passive
2. Use data binding when possible
3. Implement proper state management
4. Avoid business logic in ViewModels
5. Use dependency injection
6. Write unit tests for ViewModels
