# Memory Management in Swift

## Overview
Memory management in Swift is handled through Automatic Reference Counting (ARC), which automatically manages memory usage by tracking and managing your app's memory usage. Understanding how ARC works and avoiding memory leaks is crucial for building efficient iOS applications.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Reference Counting
- How ARC tracks references to instances
- Strong references vs weak references
- Unowned references and their use cases
- Reference cycles and how to avoid them

### 2. Memory Lifecycle
- Object allocation
- Reference management
- Deallocation
- Cleanup and deinitializers

### 3. Common Patterns
- Parent-child relationships
- Delegate patterns
- Closure capture lists
- Collection cycles

### 4. Memory Issues
- Memory leaks
- Retain cycles
- Dangling references
- Over-retention

## Best Practices

1. **Reference Management**
   - Use weak references for delegate patterns
   - Use unowned references when appropriate
   - Properly break reference cycles
   - Implement proper cleanup in deinitializers

2. **Closure Capture Lists**
   - Capture lists to break cycles
   - Weak/unowned self in closures
   - Proper variable capture
   - Avoiding retain cycles

3. **Collection Management**
   - Proper cleanup of collection items
   - Managing parent-child relationships
   - Handling circular references
   - Cache management

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Efficient memory usage
   - Timely deallocation
   - Resource management
   - Memory footprint reduction

## Common Use Cases

1. **Delegate Patterns**
   ```swift
   weak var delegate: SomeDelegate?
   ```

2. **Closure Captures**
   ```swift
   someFunction { [weak self] in
       self?.doSomething()
   }
   ```

3. **Parent-Child Relationships**
   ```swift
   class Parent {
       var children: [Child] = []
   }
   
   class Child {
       weak var parent: Parent?
   }
   ```

## Debug Tools
- Xcode Memory Graph Debugger
- Instruments for memory leaks
- Memory pressure testing
- Heap debugging

## Common Pitfalls
1. Forgetting to use weak references
2. Improper closure capture lists
3. Unbroken reference cycles
4. Missing deinitializer cleanup
