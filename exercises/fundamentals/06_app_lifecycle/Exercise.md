# App Lifecycle Exercises

## Exercise 1: State Management

### Problem

### Requirements
1. Implement all app delegate methods for state transitions
2. Handle memory warnings appropriately
3. Implement proper background task management
4. Add comprehensive logging for state transitions
5. Implement proper cleanup in each state

### Tasks
1. Create an `AppDelegate` that handles all lifecycle events
2. Implement a `Logger` service for tracking state changes
3. Create a `ResourceManager` for handling app resources
4. Implement background task handling
5. Add proper cleanup methods

### Evaluation Criteria
- All state transitions are properly handled
- Resources are properly managed
- Background tasks complete successfully
- Logging provides clear state information
- Memory warnings are handled appropriately

## Exercise 2: Background Processing

### Problem
Implement a background processing system that handles multiple types of background tasks efficiently.

### Requirements
1. Support background fetch
2. Handle background URL sessions
3. Implement background processing tasks
4. Manage task priorities
5. Handle task expiration properly

### Tasks
1. Create a `BackgroundTaskManager`
2. Implement URL session background transfers
3. Add background fetch support
4. Create a task prioritization system
5. Implement proper task completion handling

### Evaluation Criteria
- Background tasks complete successfully
- Resources are properly managed
- Tasks are prioritized correctly
- Network operations handle errors gracefully
- Battery usage is optimized

## Exercise 3: State Restoration

### Problem
Create a complex view hierarchy that properly preserves and restores its state across app launches.

### Requirements
1. Preserve complex view state
2. Handle deep navigation stacks
3. Restore user input and selections
4. Manage large datasets
5. Handle restoration failures gracefully

### Tasks
1. Implement state encoding/decoding
2. Create restoration identifier system
3. Handle complex data structures
4. Implement progressive restoration
5. Add error handling for failed restoration

### Evaluation Criteria
- State is properly preserved
- Navigation stack is restored correctly
- User input is preserved accurately
- Large datasets are handled efficiently
- Restoration failures are handled gracefully

## Exercise 4: Launch Time Optimization

### Problem
Optimize an app's launch time while maintaining proper state management and initialization.

### Requirements
1. Minimize launch time
2. Implement proper resource loading
3. Handle dependencies efficiently
4. Optimize initial rendering
5. Implement progressive loading

### Tasks
1. Create a launch time profiling system
2. Implement dependency management
3. Add progressive resource loading
4. Optimize view initialization
5. Implement caching strategies

### Evaluation Criteria
- Launch time meets performance targets
- Resources are loaded efficiently
- Dependencies are properly managed
- Initial render is optimized
- Progressive loading works smoothly

## Exercise 5: Memory Management

### Problem
Implement proper memory management during different app lifecycle states.

### Requirements
1. Handle memory warnings
2. Implement proper caching
3. Manage large resources
4. Handle state preservation
5. Implement cleanup strategies

### Tasks
1. Create a memory monitoring system
2. Implement cache management
3. Add resource cleanup methods
4. Create state preservation strategy
5. Implement memory warning handlers

### Evaluation Criteria
- Memory warnings are handled properly
- Cache is managed efficiently
- Resources are cleaned up properly
- State is preserved correctly
- Memory usage stays within limits
